# Pulse Proximity App

**Provide Bluetooth beacon and geo-fence services to your customers.**

This app targets iOS and Android.

The Pulse Proximity App works with the [Pulse Proximity Platform](https://github.com/madewithpepper/Pulse-Proximity-Platform) API to provide location aware notifications and content for Bluetooth beacons (iBeacons) and geo-fences.

The system consists of two parts; a web interface for the management and a mobile app for the end users. This is the app part.

## Building the app
Instructions on how to build the app can be found at the [docs](https://madewithpepper.com/docs).
